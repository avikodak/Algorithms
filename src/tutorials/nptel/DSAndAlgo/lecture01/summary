Algorithm : step by step instructions for converting input into required output
Program : implementation of the algorithm
Data Structure : representation of the data to effectively get required output
Input instance
Algorithm : measured in space occupied and time taken
Output
Algorithm time taken naive method : Implement algorithm in any of the programming language and measure time taken by using system utils like currenttimeinmilliseconds
	- Various across machines , 
	- Cant check for all valid inputs
Pseudo code : A mixture high level language and programming language 
By counting primitive operations
	Data transfer
	Control statements
	Arthimetic and logical operations
Big-Oh
	f(n) <= c*g(n) for n>n0 f(n) = O(g(n)) | upper bound
	
Big-Omega
	f(n) >= c*g(n) for n > n0 f(n) = bigOmega(g(n)) | lower bound
Big-theta
	c1g(n) <= f(n) <= c2g(n) f(n) = bigTheta(g(n)) | tight bound
